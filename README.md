## Description

Your project description goes here. What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?
- This project takes in 5 inputs (first name, last name, ID, Title, and Annual Salary) and puts them onto a table
- then adds up the annual salary/12 to return the total monthly cost
- Also has a delete button to remove a row from the table and reduces the total monthly cost by the Annual Salary of that row.
- if the total monthly cost is over 20k it turns RED. if the total monthly cost is reduced to below 20K by removing a row or rows it returns to its original color.
PROBLEMS
- getting the total cost to return back to its original color after deleting the row or rows that made it go over was a challenge.
SOLUTIONS
- i just had to create a separate function to handle the color change and the input for that function was the total cost value (i assigned it to the variable 'bleh' so I wouldn't confuse it with any of the other variables.)
